            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
describing the look and formatting of a document written in a
markup language. Although most often used to change the style of
web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the
language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including
plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS
is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually
engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
interfaces for many mobile applications.[1]

CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document
content from document presentation, including elements such as the
layout. colors, and fonts.[2] This separation can improve content
accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share
